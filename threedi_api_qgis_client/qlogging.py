"""Module for setting up both python and qgis logging.

In our plugin code, we just want to use ``logger.info()`` and so. This ought
to end up in a logfile we can look at for debug purposes. Ideally, customers
can mail it to us.

Log messages also ought to end up in qgis's ``QgsMessageLog`` at the bottom of
the screen (if you've enabled it). We should set this up only for our own
messages, btw.

TODO: there probably needs to be some tweaking of log levels. Perhaps the
verbosity ought to be made configurable.

        best left to the actual UI code. Some logger.error() messages should
