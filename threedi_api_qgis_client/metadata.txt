about=Work with 3Di models and simulations in the cloud from the Modeller Interface

    Check, upload and download schematizations, start calculations, and download results. A 3Di subscription is required.

	Although we aim to be as backwards compatible as possible, it is possible that at some point old schematizations
    will not work with the newest version of the plugin. We expressly disclaim any
    guarantee or warranty of compatibility between the two.
