    This includes a wizard to start calculations, and download results. A 3Di subscription is required. Use the QGIS 64-bit version on Windows. Although we aim to be as
    backwards compatible as possible, it is possible that at some point old results
    will not work with the newest version of the plugin. We expressly disclaim any
    guarantee or warranty of compatibility between the two.
